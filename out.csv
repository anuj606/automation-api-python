Hi anuj Sharma,











We're writing to let you know that over the coming weeks YouTube will be in=
troducing handles to make it easier for members of the community to find an=
d connect with each other. Your handle will be unique to your channel and w=
ill be how people mention you in comments, community posts and more.











Here's what you need to know:











We're gradually rolling out the ability to choose a handle for all channels=
 over the coming weeks, and you will receive another email and a no=
tification in YouTube Studio when you're able to choose yours. In most cases, if you already have a
personalised URL for your channel, we've reserved this for yo=
u as your handle. If you want a different handle from the one that we've re=
served, you can change it. If you don't already have a personalised URL tod=
ay, you'll also be able to choose a handle for your channel.











Starting on 14 November 2022, if you haven't yet selected a handle for your=
 channel, YouTube will automatically assign you a handle, which you can cha=
nge in YouTube Studio if you'd like to.











In the meantime, learn more about handles and all the things that you'll be=
 able to do with them:

Dear Creative Cloud User,
        We want to let you know about an upcoming change to your perso=

ud storage experience and will begin discontinuing Creative =
Cloud Synced files on 1 February 2024.
How this may impact you:





• 
Files saved to Creative Cloud Fi=
les folder on your computer will no longer automatically sync wit=
h assets.adobe.com.


• 
Files that are uploaded directly to a=
ssets.adobe.com or the Creative Cloud Mobile App will not be auto=
matically copied to your computer.  





Recommended actions:





• 
If you do not save assets to the Crea=
tive Cloud Synced files, no action is needed.


• 
Ensure your assets are properly backe=
d up locally or to third-party cloud storage.





It is important to emphasise that there will be no=
 change to Creative Cloud Documents functionality. You can still save =
files as Creative Cloud Documents via applications such as Adobe&=
nbsp;Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator; these files will remain in&=
nbsp;sync across devices.
